This is my solution for this challange. I just followed the stept in the wiki. 
In the GUI you can choose the accury of the circleFinder and the radius of the cirle: "%d %d"
The plan is as follows:
Open image
Run image to create the array of possible circles:
  Turns image in greyscale
  Applyes Sobel
  Computes the 3D array
The faster button will make the algorithm run a little faster but i will greatly reduce the accuracy.
You can save the new image with the save output button.
Get will get the circles with the accuracy in the textBox or 300.
